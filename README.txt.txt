Leap Motion Java code

In order for this code to run you must install the Leap Motion SDK that comes with the Leap motion installation, or download it from the Leap Motion website.

LeapController.class and LeapListener.class contain code for logging hand data and gives a rundown of the basic functionality of the Leap Motion SDK. 
A lot of the code is commented out, because the logged hand data overlaps and becomes convoluted.
